# Cross-Ride APIs built using Spring Boot and Gradle

Cross-Ride allows its users to register as drivers and/or riders. Registered drivers and riders advertise their usual 
travel schedule on the application. At the end of shared ride driver sends a request to the server with driver id, 
rider id, the start time of shared ride, the end time of shared ride and the distance covered in kilometers.

The application can be deployed on any compatible application server (~Java EE 7 ). 

You can run the application by running the  `main` method in `CrossRideApplication.java`
